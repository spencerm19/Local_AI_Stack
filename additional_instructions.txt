summary of the changes and configurations we've made to get the n8n Telegram trigger working, specifically focusing on enabling HTTPS access via the DuckDNS domain using Caddy Docker:

Project Goal: To enable the n8n Telegram trigger to function correctly by ensuring n8n is accessible via a public, HTTPS URL. The initial problem was Telegram's requirement for an HTTPS URL, which your setup was not providing.

Key Components Involved:

n8n: Your workflow automation tool.
Telegram: The service whose messages trigger your n8n workflow.
DuckDNS: Provides a dynamic DNS subdomain (skyewire.duckdns.org) to map your dynamic public IP address to a static hostname.
Caddy (Docker): Used as a reverse proxy to handle external requests, provide automatic HTTPS (via Let's Encrypt), and forward traffic to your internal Docker services.
Docker Compose: Manages the multi-container Docker application, defining services, networks, and volumes.
Changes Implemented:

Caddyfile Update (Enable Automatic HTTPS & Domain Specifics):

Removed auto_https off: This was the critical change. The original Caddyfile had auto_https off which prevented Caddy from automatically obtaining and managing SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt. By removing this, Caddy will now automatically handle HTTPS for your specified domains.
Hardcoded DuckDNS Domain: All instances of the {$SERVER_DOMAIN} variable were replaced with your specific DuckDNS domain, skyewire.duckdns.org. This ensures Caddy explicitly configures routing and HTTPS for subdomains like n8n.skyewire.duckdns.org, webui.skyewire.duckdns.org, etc..
n8n Reverse Proxy: The n8n.skyewire.duckdns.org block is configured to reverse_proxy n8n:5678, correctly routing traffic from your public domain to the n8n Docker service on its internal port 5678.
docker-compose.yml Update (n8n WEBHOOK_URL):

Set WEBHOOK_URL for n8n: The n8n service's environment section was updated to include WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.skyewire.duckdns.org/. This is paramount because n8n uses this variable to inform Telegram where to send webhook events (i.e., its public, HTTPS-enabled URL).
Updated N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL: Similarly, N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL was set to https://n8n.skyewire.duckdns.org/ for consistency in the editor's base URL.
Port Mapping for n8n (Optional Removal): The direct ports mapping for the n8n service (- "${N8N_PORT:-5678}:5678") was commented out. Since Caddy is now handling external access and reverse proxying, directly exposing n8n's port to the host is generally not required for external access and can be omitted for a cleaner setup.
Required Router Port Forwarding:

External Port 80 (HTTP) -> Internal Port 80 of the machine running your Caddy Docker container.
External Port 443 (HTTPS) -> Internal Port 443 of the machine running your Caddy Docker container. 
Note: Caddy needs both ports open to the internet. Port 80 is used for Let's Encrypt's initial HTTP-01 challenge, and port 443 is for the secure HTTPS traffic.
Why HOST=0.0.0.0 is correct:

We confirmed that the HOST=0.0.0.0 setting (e.g., for flowise service) within your Docker containers is correct. This configuration allows services to listen on all internal network interfaces within their respective containers, making them accessible to other containers on the same Docker network (like Caddy). No changes were needed for this setting.
Overall Outcome:

With these changes, your Caddy Docker container will now automatically obtain and manage SSL certificates for your skyewire.duckdns.org subdomains, providing the necessary HTTPS encryption. Your n8n instance will be aware of its correct public HTTPS URL, allowing it to register webhooks with Telegram successfully and receive messages securely.
